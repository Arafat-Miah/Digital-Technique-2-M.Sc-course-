# Digital Techniques 2 (DT2) — Lab Work & mycpu Project (2025)

This repository contains my coursework for **Digital Techniques 2** at the **University of Oulu**.  
It includes lab exercise reports and a structured CPU-style project (“mycpu”) implemented and verified in **SystemVerilog** using standard RTL design, simulation, and synthesis workflows. 

## Contents

### 1) Lab Reports (PDF)
- **DT2_L1.pdf … DT2_L12.pdf**  
  Each PDF documents the weekly laboratory exercises, answers, design steps, and results.

Labs cover topics such as: data types, structural modeling, combinational logic, logic synthesis, digital arithmetic, flip-flops/registers, timing analysis, FSM design, testbench techniques, gate-level verification, FSM–datapath interaction, and FPGA memories. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2) Weekly Submission Archives (tar.gz)
- Files named like: **amiah25.DT2.\*.tar.gz**  
  These are the **weekly submission packages generated for the course**. I uploaded them here so reviewers can see the actual submitted deliverables and folder structure per week (source code + produced reports/results).

To inspect an archive:
```bash
tar -xzf amiah25.DT2.<id>.tar.gz
ls
